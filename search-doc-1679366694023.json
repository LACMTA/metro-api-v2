Getting Startedâ€‹ Get started by creating a new site. What you'll needâ€‹ Node.js version 16.14 or above: When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. Generate a new siteâ€‹ Generate a new Docusaurus site using the classic template. The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command: npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor. The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus. Start your siteâ€‹ Run the development server: cd my-website npm run start The cd command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there. The npm run start command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/. Open docs/intro.md (this page) and edit some lines: the site reloads automatically and displays your changes.","keywords":""},{"title":"Hello World","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/metro-api-v2/docs/test","content":"Hello World Welcome to the Metro API Docs!","keywords":""}]
