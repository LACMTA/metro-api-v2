We'll be making regular blog updates as we work on the API and the documentation site. Our team is small but we've got big dreams and a desire to make our data more open and accessible.

Keep an eye on this space as we post about changes, tutorials, etc.  It's as much for your information as it is to keep ourselves accountable.  

Questions/comments are welcomed on our GitHub repository [discussions board](https://github.com/LACMTA/metro-api-v2/discussions).

We'd love to hear your about any [bugs or issues](https://github.com/LACMTA/metro-api-v2/issues) as well!
