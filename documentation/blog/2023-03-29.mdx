Hola Metro A-PIoneers! Today we are launching 2.1.21 of our API which is a mino version release that enables websockets!

And gosh, was it a pain to implement!!! While FastAPI has good support for websockets, our API was not meant for asynchronous calls.

Why did we need these asynchronous calls? Well, the data we wanted to send through websockets was live GTFS Real Time data that was also joined to the GTFS Static data.

## Technology Stack

The API needed to be basically re-done for async calls through `asyncpg` with `aysncio` and new updated `sqlalchemy` commands.

### asyncpg
We needed to redo the database connection to listen for live updates, so we connected using asyncpg.

``` python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession
```

We then re-did our SqlAlchemy engine to connect using the async url: 
``` python
async_engine = create_async_engine(create_async_uri(Config.DB_URI), echo=False)
async_session = sessionmaker(async_engine, expire_on_commit=False, class_=AsyncSession)
```

Finally we created a new function to connect to the database:
``` python

async def get_async_db():
    async with async_session() as db:
        try:
            yield db
        finally:
            await async_engine.dispose()
```
Phew!

### Asynchronously querying the data
Now that we were connected to the database, we had to re-do the queries!

For async calls, SqlAlchemy uses `.select` instead of `.query` so our code went from:

``` python
    the_query = db.query(gtfs_models.VehiclePosition).filter(gtfs_models.VehiclePosition.agency_id == agency_id).all()
```

to:

``` python
the_query = await session.execute(select(gtfs_models.VehiclePosition).where(gtfs_models.VehiclePosition.route_code == route_code,gtfs_models.VehiclePosition.agency_id == agency_id))
```

And the results needed to be converted to `scalars`:
```
    for row in the_query.scalars().all():
        print(row)
```

All the code is in the API's `database.py`,`main.py`, `crud.py` here: https://github.com/LACMTA/metro-api-v2/tree/main/fastapi/app.

## Conclusion

After being pummeled by websockets for the past couple of weeks, all I can say is that it's been pretty painful. 

I just can't wait until someone comes up with `webmittens` next.
